I'm a second-year PhD student interested in the *pragmatics* of programming languages: 
- How do a language's characteristics affect its usefulness in a given context?
- What causes a software developer to prefer one language over another?
- How can we improve the process by which individual languages evolve?

I study under <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/dimoulas-christos.html">Christos Dimoulas</a> at Northwestern. Right now, I'm building on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3622817">Ben Greenman's work</a> investigating the relative usefulness of performance debugging methods for sound gradually-typed codebases.
