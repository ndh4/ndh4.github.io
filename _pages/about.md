I'm a second-year PhD student interested in the *pragmatics* of programming languages:
- How do a language's characteristics affect its usefulness in a given context?
- What causes a software developer to prefer one language over another?
- How can we improve the process by which individual languages evolve?

I study under <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/dimoulas-christos.html">Christos Dimoulas</a> at Northwestern. Right now, I'm investigating the impact of design-by-contract on the size of minimal test suites.
